		<a name="title"></a><h2>Title</h2>

				<p>The title of the report normally appears at the very top. It typically lists the name of the theme, indicator and time period being displayed. It may also display any filter that you have applied to the data.</p>


		<a name="buttons"></a><h2>Buttons</h2>

				<p><em>Data Button:</em> Click this button to display the available theme(s), indicator(s) and time period(s) in the Data Explorer.</p>

				<p><em>Geography Button:</em> Click this button to display the available geographies for the base geography. If there is only one base geography in the report this button will not be available.</p>

				<p><em>Filter Button:</em> Click this button to display the available filters in the Filter Explorer. If there are no filters in the report this button will not be available.<p>

                <p><em>Help Button:</em> Click this button to access a help document.</p>

                <p>The administrator may have added further buttons to the report you are viewing.</p>


		<a name="components"></a><h2>Components</h2>

				<p>All components of the report have a small toolbar that becomes visible when you hover over the top right corner of the component (unless the administrator has disabled this).  There are three buttons available that allow the user to drag the component to another place within the report, to maximise the component to full screen and then restore it again to its original size and location or to close the component so that it disappears from the report.  The components can also be resized using the little arrows that appear when you hover over the border or corner of the component.  To restore the layout to its default upon load of the report, right-click anywhere in the screen and choose 'Reset Layout' from the context menu.</p>


		<a name="dataexplorer"></a><h2>Data Explorer</h2>

				<p>The Data Explorer lists the available themes, indicators and time periods. Click theme and indicator names to expand or collapse them. Click a time period or an indicator without a time period to load new data. The administrator may have configured the Data Explorer to not show any time periods but load only the most recent data when you select an indicator.<p>

				<p>Click '+' button in the bottom right corner of the Data Explorer to expand the available theme(s), indicator(s) and time period(s).</p>

				<p>Click '-' button in the bottom right corner of the Data Explorer to collapse the available theme(s), indicator(s) and time period(s).</p>


		<a name="filterexplorer"></a><h2>Filter Explorer</h2>

				<p>The Filter Explorer lists any available filters and their values. Click filter names to expand or collapse them. Clicking a filter value will filter the report so that only geographic features with the selected filter value are prominent. The administrator may have configured the report so that the map zooms to the filtered area. If this is the case you should use the "Zoom Full" button in the map toolbar to return to the original map extent.</p>


		<a name="geogexplorer"></a><h2>Geography Explorer</h2>

				<p>The Geography Explorer lists any available base geography. If you choose a different geography, all components of the report will update to display the data of the selected geography.</p>


        <a name="datatable"></a><h2>Data Table</h2>

                <p><em>Select features:</em> Click the name of a geographic feature to select the feature. A selected geographic feature will be shaded orange. Alternatively, hold 'Ctrl' to select multiple features or 'Shift' to select a range of features. Holding the 'Ctrl' key and clicking on a selected feature allows you to deselect it.</p>

                <p><em>Adjust column width:</em> Hold your mouse pointer over the divider between column headers and lateral arrows will appear. Click and drag the divider to adjust column width.</p>

                <p><em>Change column order:</em> Click a column header and drag it to change the location of this column within the Data Table.  E.g. if you want the notes icons to appear right of the data columns you can simply drag the whole column with the notes icons to the right border  of the data table.</p>

                <p><em>Sort Columns:</em> Click a column header to sort the table ascending/descending. Note that the Name column and the Indicator column of categoric indicators will sort alphabetically while the Indicator column of numeric indicators will sort numerically. Associate values (typically shown in columns to the right of indicator values) always sort as if they were text unless the administrator has defined otherwise.</p>

                <p><em>Magnifying Glass Icons:</em> Click the magnifying glass icons to make the map zoom to individual geographic features.</p>

                <p><em>Notes Icons:</em> Click these icons to link to external resources.</p>

                <p><em>Legend Colours:</em> Small circles shaded in the colour of the class which the data value of this area is within in the legend.  This helps to get a better visual impression of the data. </p>

                <p><em>Scroll:</em> A vertical scroll bar will be available if data cannot be viewed within the table dimensions.</p>


        <a name="map"></a><h2>Map</h2>

                <p><em>Shading:</em> Geographic features are shaded based on values in the data table according to the map legend.</p>

                <p><em>Zooming:</em> Use the slider bar on the left of the map to zoom in and out. Click the zoom full icon (bottom magnifying glass) to zoom back to full extent. Alternatively, hold 'Shift' and click and drag a box on the map. The map will zoom to the area within the box drawn. You can also use the scroll wheel on your mouse to zoom in and out of the map.</p>

				<p><em>Menu:</em> Click on the little triangle in the map toolbar to open a menu with further options for the report. These are also available via the context menu (right click mouse button) and are explained in detail in the section <a href="#contextmenu">Context Menu</a>

                <p><em>Area Selection:</em> 'Ctrl' and click and drag a box on the map. The map features within the box drawn will become selected.</p>

                <p><em>Select a Geographic Feature:</em> Click on a geographic feature to select that feature. A selected geographic feature will be shaded orange. Hold down 'Ctrl' key to select multiple map features.<p>

                <p><em>Tooltip:</em> Hold your mouse pointer over a map feature to display a tooltip with the geographic feature name and value.</p>


        <a name="barchart"></a><h2>Bar Chart</h2>

                <p><em>Bars:</em> For numeric indicator values there is a bar representing each geographic feature listed in the data table. The height of the bars is proportional to the values in the data table. Bars are displayed in the same order as the features are sorted in the data table and shading is linked to the legend.</p>

                <p><em>Select a Geographic Feature:</em> Click a bar to select the corresponding geographic feature. A selected bar will be shaded orange. Alternatively, hold 'Ctrl' to select multiple bars or 'Shift' to select a range of bars. You can also drag a box to select multiple bars on the chart. Holding the 'Ctrl' key and clicking on a selected bar allows you to deselect it.</p>

                <p><em>Error Bars:</em> The bar chart may display error bars representing the lower and upper confidence limits associated with indicator values. These give an indication of whether the differences between indicator values are statistically significant.</p>

                <p><em>Comparison Values:</em> The bar chart can display values for comparison geographies as well as features in the base geography. Values for comparison geographies are shown using a horizontal line across the chart.</p>

                <p><em>Tooltip:</em> Hold your mouse pointer over a bar to display a tooltip with the geographic feature name and value. It might also show the lower and upper confidence limit values of error bars.</p>


        <a name="boxandwhiskerchart"></a><h2>Box-and-Whisker Chart</h2>

                <p><em>Boxes and Whiskers:</em> The way you interpret this chart is dependent upon the data the administrator has chosen to present. In general though, the box is used to represent a range of values, such as an interquartile range, whereas the whiskers represent the highest/lowest values.</p>

                <p><em>Select a Geographic Feature:</em> Click a box to select the corresponding geographic feature. A selected box will be shaded orange. Alternatively, hold 'Ctrl' to select multiple boxes or 'Shift' to select a range of boxes. You can also drag a rectangle to select multiple boxes on the chart. Holding the 'Ctrl' key and clicking on a selected box allows you to deselect it.</p>

                <p><em>Tooltip:</em> Hold your mouse pointer over a box to display a tooltip with the geographic feature name, the indicator value and the values that define the box and whiskers.</p>


        <a name="piechart"></a><h2>Pie Chart</h2>

                <p><em>Slices:</em> The number of slices and shading is linked to the legend. The size of each slice is proportional to the number of geographic features in the corresponding category.</p>

                <p><em>Select a slice:</em> Click a slice to select the corresponding geographic features. A selected slice will be separate from the pie.</p>

                <p><em>Tooltip:</em> Hold your mouse over a slice to display a tooltip with the name of the category and the proportion of geographic features in this category.</p>


       <a name="advancedpiechart"></a><h2>Advanced Pie Chart</h2>

        		<p>The advanced pie chart will show you data for a hovered or selected map feature. Depending on how it has been configured it will show either associate values for the selected indicator or all indicators in the selected theme. Unless the administrator deactivated it, you will be able to compare the breakdown for two geographic features side-by-side. The name of the geographic feature will be displayed above the chart.</p>

                <p><em>Slices:</em> The number of slices and shading is linked to the legend of the advanced pie chart. The size of each slice is proportional to the indicator or associate value it represents.</p>

                <p><em>Tooltip:</em> Hold your mouse over a slice to display a tooltip with the name and value of the indicator/associate and the related percentage.</p>


        <a name="timechart"></a><h2>Time Series Chart</h2>

                <p><em>Trends:</em> The time series chart shows change in indicator values over time. Hold your mouse over a geographic feature in the map, data table or bar chart to view a trend in the time series chart. Click a feature in the map, data table or bar chart to select it and freeze the trend in the time series chart.</p>

                <p><em>Comparison Trends:</em> The time series chart may display trends for comparison geographies.</p>

				<p><em>Tooltip:</em> Hold your mouse pointer over the points for any frozen trend in the time series chart to display a tooltip with geographic feature name, the time period and value.</p>

				<p><em>Discrete Time Series Chart:</em> A variation of the time series chart is to show the time series not as trend lines but as bars for each time period. </p>

				<p><em>Flipped Time Series Chart:</em> It is possible that the discrete time series chart appears on its side with horizontal bars. </p>


		<a name="legend"></a><h2>Legend</h2>

				<p><em>Legend:</em> The legend is displayed in the map layers list. It can be controlled by clicking on the 'pencil' icon next to the base geography name in this list. This will open the Legend Settings dialogue box.</p>

				<p><em>Legend Settings:</em> The items available in the Legend Settings dialog may vary depending on the data in the report and the way the report has been configured.</p>

				<p><em>Border colour:</em> The colour of the border around each geographical feature on the map.</p>

				<p><em>Transparency:</em> By sliding the bar the transparency of the shaded features in the map can be altered.</p>

				<p><em>Palette:</em> You can change the colour palette used to shade geographic features in the map by clicking on a new palette.</p>

				<p><em>Reverse Palette:</em> By checking this box you can reverse the colour palette used to shade geographic features in the map.</p>

				<p><em>No. Classes:</em> You can increase or decrease the number of classes by clicking the Increase or Decrease buttons (labelled with black arrows). The administrator may have fixed the maximum number of classes.</p>

				<p><em>Classifiers:</em> Select a classifier from the drop-down. This will decide how the ranges are calculated.</p>

				<p><em>Equal Interval:</em> The intervals between class breaks are equal. Class breaks are calculated on-the-fly and will update if you change the number of classes. Geographic features in the same class are given the same shade. The administrator may have configured the report so that the class breaks are the same across all indicators in the report. The advantage of the equal-interval classification is that many map users will find it simple to understand. However, a disadvantage is that only the minimum and maximum data values are used when determining class breaks for the intervals (rather than the way the data is spread).</p>

				<p><em>Quantile:</em> Each class in the legend contains an approximately equal number of geographic features. Class breaks are calculated on-the-fly and will update if you change the number of classes. Geographic features in the same class are given the same shade. Two advantages of the quantile classification are that it is appropriate for ordinal data (as data are rank-ordered) and that it can help make map comparisons (assuming that the same number of classifications is used for all maps). A disadvantage of the quantile classification is that it does not consider how the data are distributed. If the data distribution is highly skewed, data observations will be forced into the same class (either the lowest or highest) where this may not be appropriate. As a result, the quantile classification may give a false impression that there is a relatively normal data distribution.</p>

				<p><em>Natural Breaks:</em> This classification method is also known as Optimal Breaks and Jenks Method. Class breaks are calculated on-the-fly and will update if you change the number of classes. Data are assigned to classes based upon their position along the data distribution relative to all other data values. An iterative algorithm is used to assign values to classes such that the variances within all classes are minimized whereas the variances among classes are maximized. The advantage of this classification is that the data distribution is explicitly considered for determining class breaks. However, the disadvantage is that map users may not understand the classification method used and that class breaks may not be immediately intuitive. </p>

				<p><em>Continuous:</em> Each geographic feature is shaded a different shade using a continuous scale. This legend type is useful for identifying extremely high or low values. Where an indicator has only a small number of unique data values (say 5 or less) this may be the most appropriate legend type to apply.</p>

				<p><em>Standard Deviation:</em> Class breaks reflect the number of standard deviations from the data average (or mean). Geographic features are classified according to how many standard deviations above or below the average their indicator value falls. Geographic features in the same class are given the same shade. You cannot change the number of classes for this legend type.</p>

				<p><em>Min Point Size:</em> If the data in your dynamic report is being displayed as proportional symbols (points), then you can set the size of the smallest point(s) here.</p>

				<p><em>Max Point Size:</em> If the data in your dynamic report is being displayed as proportional symbols (points), then you can set the size of the largest point(s) here.</p>

				<p><em>Highlighting and Selecting:</em> Hold your mouse pointer over a class in the legend to highlight the geographic features that fall into that class. Click a class to select the geographic features that fall within that class.</p>


		<a name="maplayers"></a><h2>Map Layers</h2>

				<p>Click the check boxes to toggle the base geography on / off. Contextual geographies and background images may have been included by the administrator and can also be toggled on or off using the check boxes in the map layers box. Background images are "scale dependent" - they may turn on or off as you zoom into or out of the map. Note that images may not be visible at full map extent and you may need to zoom to a smaller area for them to appear. Depending on how the report has been configured, it may take some time for background images to appear.</p>


	    <a name="comparison"></a><h2>Comparison Geographies Table</h2>

				<p>This table lists any comparison geographies that have been included in the report. The administrator may have configured the report so that comparison values are displayed in charts when you hold your mouse pointer over a comparison geography name.</p>


		<a name="timeanimation"></a><h2>Time Animation</h2>

				<p>The time animation component can be used to view how indicators change over time. You can click on the bar to change the date that is currently displayed. You can also use the left and right arrow buttons to step through each date, or click the "play" (triangle) button to cycle through all the available dates for the currently selected indicator. You can pause the animation by clicking on the pause button. The administrator may have included a speed slider which allows you to adjust the speed of the animation.</p>

		<a name="pyramidchart"></a><h2>Pyramid Chart</h2>

				<p>The pyramid chart displays indicator data belonging to one selected map feature in a back to back horizontal bar chart. This chart is typically used to show population structure broken down by age groups and gender. Simply select a geographic feature in the map, data table or bar chart to fill the pyramid chart with data for the selected feature. The bars on the right side of the chart will display the numeric indicator values of the first theme whereas the bars on the left will display the numeric indicator values of the second theme for the selected feature. The Pyramid Chart will only be able to show data for the first two themes. If the report contains more than two themes, the chart will be empty if you select an indicator which does not belong to the first two themes. </p>

				<p><em>Tooltip:</em> If you hover over one of the horizontal bars, a tooltip will appear showing the name of the selected feature as well as the indicator name and value which the bar represents.</p>


		<a name="dotplot"></a><h2>Dot Plot</h2>

				<p>The Dot Plot shows the spread of the indicator data around the mean or median.  Each dot represents the indicator value of one map feature.  The dot representing the minimum indicator value is always displayed to the very left of the chart whereas the dot for the maximum indicator value is displayed to the very right of the chart.  The dots are superimposed over a grey shaded box with whiskers. The meaning of the vertical box borders and the length of the whiskers depends on the chart type the administrator has chosen. The two possible chart types are 'distribution' and 'interquartile':</p>

				<table>
					<tr>
						<td width="200px"><em>Chart type 'distribution':</em></td>
						<td width="200px">Left whisker:</td>
						<td>-1 standard deviation</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td></td>
						<td>Left border of the box:</td>
						<td>-0.5 standard deviation</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td></td>
						<td>Vertical line in the box:</td>
						<td>The mean of the indicator values</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td></td>
						<td>Right border of the box:</td>
						<td>+0.5 standard deviation</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td></td>
						<td>Right whisker:</td>
						<td>+1 standard deviation</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<br />
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td width="200px"><em>Chart type 'interquartile':</em></td>
						<td width="200px">Left whisker:</td>
						<td>5th Percentile</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td></td>
						<td>Left border of the box:</td>
						<td>The lower quartile</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td></td>
						<td>Vertical line in the box:</td>
						<td>The median of the indicator values</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td></td>
						<td>Right border of the box:</td>
						<td>The upper quartile</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td></td>
						<td>Right whisker:</td>
						<td>95th Percentile</td>
					</tr>
				</table>

				<p>The tooltip which appears when hovering over the grey shaded box should give you an indication of which chart type is chosen.</p>


		<a name="statistics"></a><h2>Statistics Box</h2>

				<p>The Statistic Box shows several statistical figures calculated automatically from the indicator values of all features in the report. If a filter is applied the statistics will be calculated on-the-fly for just the filtered features.  This works for a filter applied through the Filter Explorer and for geographic filters which can be applied by selecting a subset of the map features, right-clicking to open the context menu and select the ‘Filter Selection’ option (unless this option has been disabled by the administrator). </p>

		<a name="googlesearch"></a><h2>Google Search</h2>

				<p>The Google Search allows you to search the map in an InstantAtlas report if it contains Google background mapping. Simply type in a post code, street name or any other location. If the Google Search could find results in the bounding box of the base layer, it will display them in a drop down list underneath the text field. Selecting an item out of the drop down list will centre the map on this location and a red marker will appear. Please note that this marker might be hidden behind the base layer or contextual layers. You can toggle map layers on and off by using the checkboxes in the legend.</p>


		<a name="scatterplot"></a><h2>Scatter Plot</h2>

				<p>The scatter plot displays the relationship between data for two different indicators or time periods. Read the axis labels to see which  data are being plotted. Hold your mouse pointer over a dot in the scatter plot to display a tooltip with the name and values of the geographic feature it relates to. The administrator may have configured the report to display a correlation coefficient, line of best fit and an equation for this line. The correlation coefficient is Pearson's Product Moment Coefficient.</p>


		<a name="bubbleplot"></a><h2>Bubble Plot</h2>

				<p>The bubble plot is a scatterplot in which the size and colour of the points can vary. Up to four indicators can therefore be represented simultaneously (x-axis value, y-axis value, size and colour). The indicator that defines bubble colour is that which is shown in the other components of the report. It may be possible to select the indicators shown in the bubble plot independently or the administrator may have pre-defined them. Hold your mouse pointer over a bubble to display a tooltip with the name and values of the geographic feature it relates to.</p>


		<a name="funnelplot"></a><h2>Funnel Plot</h2>

				<p>The funnel plot is a scatterplot upon which confidence limits have been superimposed. It is useful when observations for different areas are based on varying sample/population sizes. The funnel shaped confidence limits indicate that as sample/population sizes decrease, an observation must be further from the regional/national average to be statistically significantly different. Hold your mouse pointer over a point to display a tooltip with the name and value of the geographic feature it corresponds to.</p>


		<a name="spinechart"></a><h2>Spine Chart</h2>

				<p>The spine chart displays cross-indicator information (i.e. a profile) for any selected area(s). It may do this using text, symbols and proportional bars. A legend is shown at the bottom of the chart. Select a geographic feature in the map, data table or bar chart to make it appear in the spine chart. It may be possible to select further features by holding down the 'Ctrl' key and clicking them. The proportional bars will show in a different colour for each different geographic feature. The geographic feature name(s) together with their bar colour will be displayed in the spine chart legend. </p>

				<p>The proportional bars usually represent either the indicator values themselves or a percentage difference between the indicator value and a regional/national comparator. Target values may be superimposed as vertical bars. For each indicator, minimum/maximum values may be shown at either side of each bar. The bars themselves may be superimposed on coloured ranges that show how an area is performing. You can scroll the chart to see indicators that are listed further up or down.  By clicking on a row in the spine chart you may be able to change the indicator being shown in the map, bar chart and pie chart.  At the bottom of the spine chart you will find '-' and '+' buttons. These will collapse and expand the themes in the chart.</p>


		<a name="radarchart"></a><h2>Radar Chart</h2>

				<p>The radar chart displays cross-indicator information for any selected area(s). The name of the selected area(s) will be displayed below the chart. The chart will show the data values for each theme and indicator joined by a coloured line for the selected area(s). The lines are semi-transparent so that you can compare them even when they overlap. You can hover over the line nodes to see tooltips showing the area name, theme name, indicator name and value.


		<a name="contextmenu"></a><h2>Context Menu (right click mouse button)</h2>

				<p><em>Clear Selection:</em> This option allows you to deselect all geographic features that are currently selected.</p>

				<p><em>Clear Comparison Selection:</em> This option allows you to deselect all comparison geographies.</p>

				<p><em>Filter Selection:</em> This option allows you to create a filter from the geographic features that are currently selected.</p>

				<p><em>Clear Filter:</em> This option allows you to clear a filter that has been applied.</p>

				<p><em>Print Preview:</em> This option allows you to print either the full InstantAtlas dynamic report or individual components of the report.  You can decide if you want to print the dynamic report in 'Vector' or 'Bitmap' format. If you wish your vector layers to have transparency (e.g. if you have background mapping switched on) you should choose to print in 'Bitmap' format. If you do not require  transparency you may choose the 'Vector' format which provides better quality - note that this option will only take effect if the resize option is selected below.</p>
			    <p>There are two print modes available: 'Rescale to fit page' or 'Resize to fit page'. 'Rescale to fit page' means that you will get exactly what you see on your screen as a printout, rescaled to fit the paper size. The quality of the output (especially text) might not be quite as crisp as for the resize option. 'Resize to fit page' means that the report internally resizes all components individually to fit to the paper size. The output will be crisp but text in the report may appear larger than on the screen, you might see different chart axis labels and scroll bars may appear although they are not present on your screen.</p>
			    <p>You have the options to have the buttons within the InstantAtlas dynamic report showing in your printed output.  You can also choose to have the images and the background appear in the printed output by checking or unchecking the respective boxes.</p>

				<p><em>Export:</em> This option allows you to export the full InstantAtlas dynamic report or individual components of the report in either JPEG or PNG format.</p>

				<p><em>Reset Layout:</em> This option allows you to return to the original layout of the InstantAtlas dynamic report.</p>

				<p><em>Add Text:</em> This option opens a text editor window that allows you to add custom text to the report. Different styles for the text can be defined before it is added. Once in the report, the text can be dragged to a different position. The 'Remove All' button of the text editor window deletes all custom text. Single text elements can get removed by selecting and pressing the 'Delete' key on your keyboard.</p>

				<p><em>Add Shape:</em> This option opens a shape editor window that allows you to add custom shapes to the report. Different styles for the shape can be defined before it is added. Once in the report, the shape can be dragged to a different position. The 'Remove All' button of the shape editor window deletes all custom shapes. Single shapes can get removed by selecting and pressing the 'Delete' key on your keyboard.</p>


        <a name="capture"></a><h2>Screen Captures</h2>

                <p>As well as printing or exporting via the Context Menu, you can capture an InstantAtlas report as a screen capture. Make sure the graphics are as large as possible and then hold down Ctrl-Alt-Prnt Scrn on your keyboard. Open another application, such as Word or PowerPoint, and paste (hold down Ctrl-V on your keyboard) the screen grab. You can then edit the graphics (crop, resize, sharpen, etc.) as required.</p>
